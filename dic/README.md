## Dictionaries
The dictionaries here are provided as a convenience.
NNSVS/ENUNU doesn't support multi-syllable words at this time which limits the usefulness of these dictionaries.
For training you should ONLY use the blank.table file with a phonetic ust/score. If you want to use a dictionary you should replace it after training.

Explaination of the dictionaries:

blank.table - Standard phonetic table. For training and using voices phonetically rather than lexically.

* es-base.table - Full phoneme Spanish dictioanry, with default trasncriptions. Includes phonemes that are dropped by most speakers and won't work for most.
