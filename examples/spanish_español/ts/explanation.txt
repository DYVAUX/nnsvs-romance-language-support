In upper class chilean dialents, [ch] is sometimes replaced with [ts]. The [ts] phoneme is provided for this purpose as it won't be picked up contextually.
some speakers switch between the two and others always replace the sound.
if they almost always replace the sound, then label as [ch].
The lab file can be opened in wavesurfer.
